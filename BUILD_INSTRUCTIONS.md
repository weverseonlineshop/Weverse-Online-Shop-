# K.C.O Global Marketplace — Android Build Instructions

- Android SDK (API 34+)
- Node.js 18+

## App Identity
- **Package Name / Application ID**: `com.kcoglobalonlinemarket.app`
- **Version Name**: `1.0.0`
- **Version Code**: `1`

## Permissions Used
| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `INTERNET` | Network access for Supabase, API calls, and website content |

## Build Steps

### 1. Build the web assets
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Sync web assets to the Android project
```bash
npx cap copy android
npx cap sync android
```

### 3. Open in Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```

### 4. Generate a signing keystore (one-time)
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/kco-release.keystore -alias kco-release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### 5. Create keystore.properties
Copy `android/keystore.properties.example` to `android/keystore.properties` and fill in your keystore details.

### 6. Build the signed AAB
In Android Studio:
- **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK → Android App Bundle**
- Select your keystore, enter passwords
- Select the `release` build variant
- Click **Finish**

Or from the command line:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The signed AAB will be at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### 7. Verify the AAB
```bash
# Check the bundle is valid
bundletool build-apks --bundle=app-release.aab --output=app.apks --mode=universal
# Install on a connected device for testing
bundletool install-apks --apks=app.apks
```
